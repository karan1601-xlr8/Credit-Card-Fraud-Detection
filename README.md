# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions accounting for only 0.172% of the total. The main challenge is handling this imbalance while ensuring the model effectively identifies fraud without generating excessive false positives.
